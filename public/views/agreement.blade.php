If a Partner has not responded to a SPORTOFITT order confirmation email within 24 hours SPORTOFITT will have the right to take such action in respect of the Order as it deems reasonable in its sole discretion (including cancelling the Order, in which case the Partner may be deemed to be in material breach of this Agreement).</p>

                                            <p>In respect of all Orders, the Partner&rsquo;s cancellation/amendment policy must comply with the cooling off periods required by law (which shall supersede any Partner cancellation/amendment policies that do not offer at least as consumer-friendly provisions as the applicable law). The Partner&rsquo;s attention is also drawn to the cancellation policy at clause 5 of the Customer Booking Terms and Conditions&nbsp;which policy (or at least as favourable alternatives) the Partner is obliged to offer all Customers.</p>
                                        </li>

In the event that a Partner is unable or unwilling to fulfil an Order pursuant to a Customer requesting such a change, SPORTOFITT reserves the right to treat that Order as cancelled by the Partner and refund the Customer the full amount of the Order but require the Partner nonetheless to pay the applicable amount of Commission that would have been due from the Partner in respect of that Order if it deems reasonable to do so in all the circumstances &ndash; in its sole discretion.</p>

                                            <p>The Partner is responsible for ensuring that all Partner Content (especially details of and prices for the Partner Services) that it publishes or provides to SPORTOFITT to publish on the Page(s) is accurate and correct and not misleading.</p>

                                            <p>Further, the Partner must supply the Partner Services at a price which is the best available rate offered directly in the Partner&rsquo;s venue or through other public or widely available channels of the Partner. If a Customer provides proof of a better price available elsewhere for Partner Services booked through use of the SPORTOFITT Services, SPORTOFITT reserves the right to refund the Customer the difference and adjust the amount of any payments due to the Partner in connection with those Partner Services accordingly.</p>

                                            <p>The Partner, in particular, is responsible for setting out on their Page(s) any terms and conditions that will apply to Customer Orders (including their cancellation and refund policy &ndash; which must be in line with clause 5.4 above). It is particularly drawn to Partner&rsquo;s attention that Customers, as a matter of law, will not be bound by any terms and conditions in respect of an Order if those terms and conditions are not brought to the attention of the Customer prior to their placing the Order. The Partner should bear this in mind when creating the Partner Content to include on their Page(s). It is preferred by SPORTOFITT that additional terms and conditions are included directly within the relevant Page(s) but if this is not reasonably possible then Partner may provide a link to a self contained webpage which houses those terms and conditions. Such self-contained webpages must 1) be no more than a single click away from the relevant Page(s) and 2) must not link directly or indirectly to any other website or web pages (including the Partner&rsquo;s own website).</p>

However, these terms and conditions must be made clear to the Customer prior to purchase (in line with clause 5.8 above) and cannot be changed after the Customer has made the Order. The Partner will also be responsible for verifying the validity and unique usage of an e-Voucher.</p>

                                            <p>The Partner hereby acknowledges and accepts that the Website includes a reviewing platform, upon which Customers may post publicly viewable reviews about their experiences with SPORTOFITT and with the Partner (particularly in relation to the Partner Services) (<strong>&ldquo;User Generated Content&rdquo;</strong>). The Partner should note that this platform may not be opted out from and may from time to time contain negative reviews and/or feedback from consumers, which is outside SPORTOFITT&rsquo;s control. There is an option for the Partner, if they are the subject of any User Generated Content, to reply to reviews about them. However, any content the Partner posts in response to User Generated Content must be polite and professional and non-threatening or confrontational, and it may be subject to review by SPORTOFITT (and removed or amended in SPORTOFITT&rsquo;s sole discretion if SPORTOFITT deems reasonably necessary). For the avoidance of doubt, the Partner shall have no right to any remedy (including without limitation, any right to terminate this Agreement) as a result of any User Generated Content naming or referring to the Partner. However, if the Partner, acting reasonably, feels that any User Generated Content is defamatory of the Partner or any person or in some other way is a violation of any person&rsquo;s legal rights, the Partner may flag and report that User Generated Content to SPORTOFITT. In such case, SPORTOFITT shall review the same and in its sole discretion take any action it deems necessary or desirable (including, for example, removing or amending the relevant piece of User Generated Content).</p>
