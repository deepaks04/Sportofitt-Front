            <p><font color="#4a4a49"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN">The Partner must accept all Orders and may only decline to accept the same in exceptional circumstances &ndash; otherwise the Partner shall be considered to be in material breach of this Agreement and may forfeit any payments due to it in connection with this Agreement.</span></font></font></p>
            <p><font color="#4a4a49"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN">The Partner will be responsible for confirming receipt of each Order using the confirmation link in the SPORTOFITT order confirmation email within 24 hours of receipt. If a Partner has not responded to a SPORTOFITT order confirmation email within 24 hours SPORTOFITT will have the right to take such action in respect of the Order as it deems reasonable in its sole discretion (including cancelling the Order, in which case the Partner may be deemed to be in material breach of this Agreement).</span></font></font></p>
            <p><font color="#4a4a49"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN">In respect of all Orders, the Partner&rsquo;s cancellation/amendment policy must comply with the cooling off periods required by law (which shall supersede any Partner cancellation/amendment policies that do not offer at least as consumer-friendly provisions as the applicable law). The Partner&rsquo;s attention is also drawn to the cancellation policy at clause 5 of the Customer Booking Terms and Conditions&nbsp;</span></font></font><font color="#546997"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN"><a href="https://www.wahanda.com/info/terms-of-use/#booking-terms">[2]</a></span></font></font><font color="#4a4a49"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN">&nbsp;which policy (or at least as favourable alternatives) the Partner is obliged to offer all Customers.</span></font></font></p>
            <p><font color="#4a4a49"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN">If a Customer wishes to change the date and/or time of an Order, provided the Customer contacts the Partner to do so within 24 hours (or 48 or 72 hours in some cases) of the time/date of the booking taking place, the Partner must offer the Customer a suitable alternative booking time and/or date. In the event that a Partner is unable or unwilling to fulfil an Order pursuant to a Customer requesting such a change, SPORTOFITT reserves the right to treat that Order as cancelled by the Partner and refund the Customer the full amount of the Order but require the Partner nonetheless to pay the applicable amount of Commission that would have been due from the Partner in respect of that Order if it deems reasonable to do so in all the circumstances &ndash; in its sole discretion.</span></font></font></p>
            <p><font color="#4a4a49"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN">The Partner is responsible for ensuring that all Partner Content (especially details of and prices for the Partner Services) that it publishes or provides to SPORTOFITT to publish on the Page(s) is accurate and correct and not misleading.</span></font></font></p>
            <p><font color="#4a4a49"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN">Further, the Partner must supply the Partner Services at a price which is the best available rate offered directly in the Partner&rsquo;s venue or through other public or widely available channels of the Partner. If a Customer provides proof of a better price available elsewhere for Partner Services booked through use of the SPORTOFITT Services, SPORTOFITT reserves the right to refund the Customer the difference and adjust the amount of any payments due to the Partner in connection with those Partner Services accordingly.</span></font></font></p>
            <p><font color="#4a4a49"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN">The Partner, in particular, is responsible for setting out on their Page(s) any terms and conditions that will apply to Customer Orders (including their cancellation and refund policy &ndash; which must be in line with clause 5.4 above). It is particularly drawn to Partner&rsquo;s attention that Customers, as a matter of law, will not be bound by any terms and conditions in respect of an Order if those terms and conditions are not brought to the attention of the Customer prior to their placing the Order. The Partner should bear this in mind when creating the Partner Content to include on their Page(s). It is preferred by SPORTOFITT that additional terms and conditions are included directly within the relevant Page(s) but if this is not reasonably possible then Partner may provide a link to a self contained webpage which houses those terms and conditions. Such self-contained webpages must 1) be no more than a single click away from the relevant Page(s) and 2) must not link directly or indirectly to any other website or web pages (including the Partner&rsquo;s own website).</span></font></font></p>
            <p><font color="#4a4a49"><font face="inherit, serif"><span lang="en-IN">In respect of eVoucher Bookings, the Partner may set an expiry date and other reasonable terms and conditions for their use. However, these terms and conditions must be made clear to the Customer prior to purchase (in line with clause 5.8 above) and cannot be changed after the Customer has made the Order.
